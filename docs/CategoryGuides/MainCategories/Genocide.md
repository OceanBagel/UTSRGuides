# Genocide

<img src='./Images/UTSRGuidesHeader.png'></img>

## Introduction

The Genocide category focuses on optimally killing all the monsters necessary for every area and killing the boss at the end of each area. This category is heavily influenced by RNG because most of the encounters in the game are influenced by RNG. Some encounters are faster than others, and the amount of time spent waiting for an encounter can be random as well.

***Timing starts on "YES" on name confirmation.***

## Ruins

> Kills Required: 20

### Handholding / Toriel Skip

After hitting “Yes” at the name selection, you should hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>, so you can start moving as soon as possible.

Walk down the hallway to the right. Enter the doorway. Walk up towards Flowey and begin his dialogue. Mash the text and begin the battle.

Mash away the text as soon as Flowey talks to you. After Flowey winks, you won't be able to mash the text away. Instead, repeatedly press <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>, so you will end the text as soon as it reaches the end.

After Flowey winks, you will want to position yourself a little bit to the right of the top left corner. Being here will ensure that you get hit by the ~~bullets~~ friendliness pellets as soon as possible.

After being hit by the friendliness pellets, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>◀ Left</kbd>. Moving to the bottom left corner and holding down the <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> arrow keys will make the circle attack hit you quicker than normal.

After being hit, prepare your mashing once again. Once Toriel appears, mash away her text.

You can hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> while mashing the text to move upwards as soon as you are able to. After mashing away Toriel's text, follow her upwards into the next room.

In the first room, walk up the staircase around the save point and into the door. Don't bother saving, it just wastes time. In the next room, mash away Toriel's text and hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>. You don't need to move to enter the door.

This next room is a bit hard to do optimally. Hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> as you mash Toriel's text. When you get past the bridge, start wall humping and press <kbd>Z</kbd> when you pass the switch. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> until Toriel walks out of the way, and then do the same thing for the 2nd switch. After hitting the 2nd switch, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>-<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and mash away Toriel's text.

In the next room, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>-<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> while mashing away Toriel's text and then interact with the dummy. Go to ACT and select “Talk” to spare the dummy.

In the next room, mash away Toriel's text and follow her. You will encounter a Froggit. Hit the Froggit with a critical attack for 20 or more damage to increase your LV to 2; if you hit the Froggit for 19 or less, it's a reset. Mash away her text and watch the hand-hold cutscene. Take a sip of water, staying hydrated is important.

Alternatively, you can do Toriel Skip. Note that in Genocide, Toriel Skip also skips the first frog. Also Note that Toriel Skip is a very hard and inconsistent skip. As a result, it is not recommended for begginers to do Toriel Skip.

Toriel Skip saves around 25 seconds, due to skipping the dummy room, the handholding room, and the first frog. This is less time than in other categories due to being at a lower level on the first encounter grind.

When entering the dummy room, mash toriel's text and then hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>-<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> until you're right next to Toriel, mash until you're on the last textbox (either "Well, I thought it was amusing" for first time talking with her, or "You can say anything... the dummy will not be bothered" if it's not the first time), and then holding right and doing two consecutive z/enter inputs (like an overflow, see [here](/GeneralGuides/GeneralGuide?id=exploits-and-glitches "overflows") for more info) This moves you one pixel to the right inside of toriel.

From here, there are 3 methods you can do:

1. The double overflow method - Advance to Toriel's last textbox, hold right, and do two consecutive z/enter inputs, mash away Toriel's text (two textboxes) and let go of right before you finish mashing her text.

2. The tap method - Release right and clear Toriel's text Press z or enter and then right on consecutive frames, mash away Toriel's text (two textboxes) and let go of right before you finish mashing her text.

3. The menu method - Release right and clear Toriel's text, open the menu, hold right, then press one of x, c, shift, or ctrl and then one of z or enter on consecutive frames, mash away Toriel's text (two textboxes) and let go of right before you finish mashing her text 

A few miscellaneous points:

If you enter the next room normally, you either didn't mash fast enough or you didn't release right soon enough.

If you softlock, you either overmashed and interacted with Toriel a second time or your final z/enter input was a frame late and you didn't mash fast enough.

If you don't release right, the mashing becomes frame perfect.

If your final z/enter press was a frame late (Toriel will turn to face forward for a frame with the double overflow method), you have 2 possible frames to clear the text and successfully wrong warp.

If you make the correct inputs, you have 3 possible frames to clear the text and successfully wrong warp.

Since you only need to clear two textboxes, a good mashing strat is to press the keys in the order x > z > lshift > enter, rolling/sliding across the three keys on the left and then pressing enter at the end.

This next room is the hardest room in the game. Walk right and mash away Toriel's text.

### First Half Ruins

Possible Random Encounters:

- Froggit: 50%
- Whimsun:  50%

In the first room with the leaves, you will get a phone call at the very beginning. Don't save at the save point, go down & right towards the next room. Begin wall humping right next to the exit to get an encounter.

- If you get a Whimsun, FIGHT it and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Any hit will kill it immediately.
- If you get a Froggit, land one accurate hit on it. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> when it begins to attack. If you get the frog attack, you will run into the frog and end the turn early. If you get the flies attack, simply dodge the flies. After enduring the attack, finish it off with a semi-accurate hit.
  - You can predict the Froggit's attack based on what it says. “Meow” and “Hop Hop” = Flies attack, “Ribbit” = Frog attack, “Croak” = 50% chance for either attack. Overall, you have a ~40% chance to get a Frog Attack.

After ending the encounter, go into the next room and begin Wall Humping immediately; grind out another encounter. Alternate between these two rooms & grind encounters until you have 11 kills total.

After grinding out 11 kills, go to the 2nd room with the cracked floor, fall into the pit, and head through the door on the right. Grind out one more encounter for a total of 12 kills before going to the next room.

In the room with the single rock, you will receive two phone calls at the beginning. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> & <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> into the rock to push it onto the switch. You will receive a third phone call, then grind out another encounter for a total of 13 kills. Exit the room.

You can skip the third phone call by reading the sign along the top wall before pushing the rock. This saves a small amount of time.

In the next room with the pit puzzle, simply navigate through the pit traps. If you don't know the pattern, fall through the floor and observe the path through the leaves. Be careful not to fall in this room because it wastes a big chunk of time. Don't grind for an encounter in this room, proceed to the next room.

### Second Half Ruins

Possible Random Encounters:

- Froggit/Whimsun: 25%
- Moldsmal x3: 25%
- Single Moldsmal: 25%
- Froggit x2: 15%
- Moldsmal x2: 10%

In the room with the three rocks, position yourself to the right of the bottom rock. Talk to the rock three times until it reaches the end and lowers the spikes. Walk to the right until the spikes rise again, turn around, and talk to the rock for a fourth time to lower the spikes permanently. Grind for an encounter. After ending the encounter, enter into the cheese room and walk back into the Three Rock room.

The best encounter you can get in this room is a Froggit/Whimsun. Kill the Whimsun first so you can get the frog attacks with the Froggit.

You will get encounters with varying amounts of Moldsmals. FIGHT the moldsmals the same way you would fight a Froggit. A single Moldsmal is the worst encounter you can get in this room.

You may also encounter two Froggits. Kill one of them first so you can get frog attacks from the other.

Grind encounters until you reach 20 kills. If you are in an encounter and get your 20th kill, flee from the remaining monsters. Exit into the cheese room.

### Leaving the Ruins

Don't save in the cheese room, just head right into the exit. If you're bored, you can wall hump along the wall and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> as you pass the mouse hole.

If you counted correctly and are at 20 kills, Napstablook will disappear as you enter the room. Walk past where Napstablook was and take the exit at the top.

Go right in the hallway after Napstablook. You will get what seems to be an encounter. However, there will be no monsters and the text will simply read, “But nobody came...”. This is your confirmation that you are on the Genocide route. Continue heading right, get a phone call from Toriel, and exit the room.

In the room with six pit traps, go the top-middle one. Fall into the trap and hit the switch at the bottom. Go through the door to return to the main room and exit to the right.

In the first switch room, go to the exit at the bottom right.

In the second switch room, go to the right of the switch behind the first pillar and activate it. Head to the exit at the bottom-left.

In the third switch room, activate the switch behind the pillar at the end of the room. Exit the room upwards.

In the fourth switch room, activate the switch behind the top-left pillar. Then head right towards the exit.

In the next room, go upwards at the three-way intersection. Don't bother grabbing the toy knife.

In the next room, mash Toriel's text and enter her house. Don't save because it's slow.

Mash Toriel's text when you enter the house and then head right to follow her into the hallway. Mash her text until Toriel leaves. Head left and exit back into the foyer.

If you so choose, you can go inside the room to sleep and grab the pie. The pie is a full heal, however grabbing it wastes a moderate amount of time. And there are better healing items available to you later in the game.

After leaving the hallway, head left through the foyer and into the living room. Talk with Toriel. When she tells you about a snail fact, choose the second option (how to leave the ruins). If you miss this option, talk to her again and choose the second option.

Follow Toriel downstairs and mash her text when she stops you. When you reach the end of the hallway, start the battle with Toriel.

When Toriel's battle begins, Mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> to FIGHT & hit her as soon as possible. Any attack will one-shot her. Continue mashing <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> to finish her text. After her heart breaks, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> & exit the hallway. Continue holding <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> through the next room. Walk up to Flowey.

Mash Flowey's text, then enter the door behind him to leave the ruins.

## Snowdin

> Kills Required: 16

### Dogs & Puzzles & Skeletons

Walk right down the long hallway. Mash Sans' text when you meet him. After meeting Sans, you will be put in another cutscene with Papyrus and Sans. Mash through the text and head right. Sans will talk to you right before exiting the room, mash through this as well.

In the next room, interact with the savepoint if you need health. Go to the chest and take out the Tough Glove & equip it. Head right and encounter a Snowdrake. Kill the Snowdrake with a very accurate hit (green) followed by an inaccurate hit (red); then exit to the right.

In the next room, mash through the cutscene and then proceed right down the path. There is a 10% chance you'll get a phone call near the middle of the room. Begin mashing beforehand in case you do get the phone call. Getting the call is a small time loss. You should encounter an Icecap before reaching the end of the room. Kill the Icecap with an accurate hit and then exit right.

Head right in Doggo's room until Doggo appears from his house. Mash the text and begin the fight.

FIGHT Doggo and hit him with a very accurate hit. Doggo will use a slow sword attack that requires you to be completely still to dodge. You can speed up the attack by running into the sword and purposely taking damage. FIGHT Doggo again and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> when hitting him. Your accuracy does not matter.

**DOGGO DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE KILL COUNT.**

After killing Doggo, exit right.

In the room with the Frozen Pond, don't slide on the ice (sliding on the ice will not progress the step counter). Walk below the ice to get the steps in. Once you reach the end of the ice pond room, grind out an encounter (it should take only a little bit of time). You will encounter the lesser dog. On the first turn, go to ACT and select Pet (alternatively, you can go to ITEM and use the stick). Endure Lesser Dog's attack and then FIGHT on the 2nd turn. You will one-shot them regardless of accuracy. Unlike the other royal guard dogs, **Lesser Dog counts towards the kill count.** After killing Lesser Dog, exit to the right.

If you need some healing items, you can choose to go above the Ice Pond and grab the Snowman Pieces. They heal 45 HP each and are a nice safety heal for Sans/Undyne. If you choose to go for the Snowman Pieces, grind for Lesser Dog against the trees before going into the next room to grab them. Then, after going back into the Ice Pond room, grind for an extra encounter before exiting the Ice Pond room.

In Papyrus' electric maze room, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and mash all the text. Once the cutscene is over, head right to exit.

In the next room, cross the bridge, head down & right, squeeze between the tree and the cliff, and walk past the snowdecahedron. DON'T GET STUCK ON THE SNOWDECAHEDRON.

In the cold spaghetti room, don't get distracted by the spaghetti and don't save. Exit right.

In the Snow Puzzle room, go down and right to the bridge. Grind an encounter on the bridge. Don't walk too far and trigger the cutscene. Kill whatever you encounter except Jerry. If you encounter Jerry, spare him immediately. This does not end the Genocide route. 

After finishing an encounter, go right to encounter Dogamy & Dogaressa. Mash through the Dog Lovers text and begin the battle. Once the battle begins, select FIGHT and target Dogaressa.

It will take a hit in the green, a hit in the yellow, and a hit in the red of the bar to kill Dogaressa. Once Dogaressa is dead, Dogamy will take one accurate hit to kill. FIGHT Dogamy and execute him.

**DOGAMY & DOGARESSA DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE KILL COUNT.**

After the battle, proceed downwards to the next room.

In the first XO puzzle room, go right and exit right.

In the second XO puzzle room, go right and exit right once more.

In the Color Tile puzzle room, go right and then mash through the cutscene. Exit right.

In the Ice puzzle room, don't worry about touching the X's. Just go straight to the switch and across the bridge. Enter the next room on the right.

Walk to the right and go to the snow poff blocking the exit to the room. Try to not get caught on any other snow poffs on the way there. Watch the cutscene and begin the battle with Greater Dog. You will need 2 accurate hits and one inaccurate hit to kill Greater Dog.

Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> for all of Greater Dog's attacks. If you get an attack with a sleeping dog at the bottom of the frame, run into the dog to end the attack early. If you get a spear attack, dodge the spear. The sleeping dog attack is around 5 seconds faster.

**GREATER DOG DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE KILL COUNT.**

After killing Greater Dog, walk right and exit the room.

### Snowdin Grind & Papyrus Fight

Possible Random Encounters:

- Icecap & Jerry: 56.67%
- Icecap, Chilldrake, & Jerry: 43.33%

In the Gauntlet of Terror room walk across the bridge and trigger the last cutscene of the Forest. Mash through the cutscene, hold <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> as the screen slides back to you, and leave out the door on the left side of the room to reset the room.

Immediately walk back into the Gauntlet of Terror Room and start grinding for encounters. Depending on the encounter you got before the Dog Lovers, you should be at 4 or 5 kills (up to 6 or 7 if you went for the Snowman Pieces). After each encounter, leave and reenter Snowdin out the left door and grind again. Repeat until you have 13 or 14 kills.

Once you have 13 or more kills, leave and reenter, then cross over to the right side of the room and grind out another encounter. If you get lucky, this will be the final encounter and you can immediately leave and proceed to the Papyrus fight. If you get unlucky, you will need to get one more encounter. Do this by leaving and re-entering out the right side of the room, then grinding the final encounter.

When you get a Triple encounter, FIGHT the Icecap first. Then, after Chilldrake's attack, menu down to FIGHT Chilldrake. Accidentally fighting Jerry wastes a turn.

You can dodge Chilldrake's spinning blades attack by sitting in the bottom-left corner of the frame. Try not to get hit on the way to the corner.

Spare Jerry unless killing Jerry brings your kill count to 16. Jerry takes a long time to kill, but killing Jerry is faster than grinding for an encounter at 15 kills.

Optimal RNG is getting the Icecap/Jerry encounter up until 10-12 kills. After that, it is optimal to get the Triple encounter.

After getting the necessary kills, head into Snowdin. Walk right, past the shop and the inn. Don't use the save point or the box. Use the igloo to get to the other side of town faster. After leaving the igloo, exit through the right side of town.

Walk down the hallway. Once the silhouettes of both Frisk and Papyrus appear, Papyrus will begin to talk. Mash all the text and begin the battle.

Immediately FIGHT Papyrus and hit him. Any hit will kill him. After hitting Papyrus, wait for him to die. When you regain movement, walk right and enter Waterfall.

## Waterfall

> Kills Required: 18

### SGS, Spears, & Glad Dummy

Keep walking right. Don't save.

In the Waterfall room, walk straight and exit right.

If you need some extra protection, there's a hidden entrance in the middle of the waterfall. Inside the waterfall, you will find the Tutu. The Tutu is a nice boost in defense and lessens the damage you will take. However, grabbing the Tutu wastes time and reduces your chances of fleeing successfully. Due to this, it is advised to hold off on equipping the Tutu for now.

The next room contains a major skip called Sea-grass Skip (SGS). This skip saves 30 seconds, and involves using an item or the cell phone in a 5 frame window before a cutscene starts, allowing you to skip the cutscene.

There are 3 methods to perform SGS.

The first method is known as the 5 Buffer Method. To perform this method, first enter the room and start the cutscene as normal. It saves 7-8 frames to walk all the way to the top before entering the papyrus cutscene. After Papyrus walks away, move 5 pixels to the right. You can either tap <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> or menu buffer <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>. You'll know you've gone far enough when the gem on the wall is aligned with the left edge of the screen, as shown in the image below.

<img src='./Images/SGSAlignment.png' alt="Sea Grass Skip alignment" title="Sea Grass Skip alignment"></img>

Next, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>▶ Right</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> all on the same frame to move to the right, open your menu, and select the highlighted menu option, and then mash <kbd>Z</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd> to use the cell phone. You only have 5 frames between moving right and the cutscene starting, so you need to perform this quickly. If you performed SGS correctly, you'll see text on the screen as the camera pans to Undyne. Mash away this text and continue to the right, making sure to stay on the lower half of the path to avoid running into the save point.

The second method is known as the 1 Buffer Setup or Shayy Setup. When you enter the room, move up only 2 pixels. Then start the papyrus cutscene. After the cutscene ends, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> until you hit the wall. You will then be lined up perfectly so that the next buffer in any direction will trigger the seagrass cutscene. Perform the buffer the same way as the previous setup. This method saves time due to requiring less buffers, and is considered to be safer.

The third method, the fastest but also the most difficult, is known as the 0 Buffer Setup. When you enter the room, walk all the way to the top. Walk into the papyrus cutscene, and mash away his text. Continue holding <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>. After walking 5-8 frames, press <kbd>C</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> and then <kbd>Z</kbd>. This method only saves a second over the previous 2.

After performing the skip, walk right to exit the room.

Video demonstration for the 3 setups:

</div>

In the first flower bridge room, just head right. The flower bridge will already be constructed for you.

In the second flower bridge room, you will get a scripted encounter with Aaron before crossing the bridge. FLEE from Aaron as soon as the encounter begins. Cross the bridge, head up, cross over the river on the flower bridge, and head through the doorway at the top.

In the telescope puzzle room, skip the telescope and head upwards towards the secret exit. You will get a scripted encounter with Woshua. FIGHT Woshua and dispatch them with a green hit followed by a red hit. Exit through the doorway at the top of the screen.

In the Bridge room, head right and ride the wooden platform across the water. Exit right.

In the long bridge room, Undyne will appear and begin to throw spears at you as you navigate to the next room. You need to minimize the amount of times you get hit by the spears & to minimize the time you spend stopping to avoid them.

You can manipulate the angle at which the spears are thrown based on your position on the walkway. This can help you dodge, but keep in mind that Undyne's spears have a bit of RNG involved with them. You still need to pay attention to the spears direction even if you've angled them favorably.
Frisk's hitbox is weird; they can get hit slightly below their feet, and the majority of their head doesn't really seem to have a hitbox.
In the second room of the chase, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> to avoid the spears. A cutscene will play when you've reached the end of the chase. Hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> to move as soon as the cutscene ends. After exiting the patch of grass, Monster Kid will appear and talk to you. Mash their text and then exit the room through the right.

Don't bother saving in the crystallized cheese room unless you are in need of health.

In the next room, go right and go down the bridge. Exit downwards.

In the next room with the assorted bridges and talking flowers, go to the right at the turn and head downwards. Turn left onto the bridge heading left. Before entering into the room on the left, grind out an encounter. You will get an encounter of two scripted Moldsmals. FIGHT both of them; they both require one hit in the green to kill.

After the encounter, exit left. Interact with the Ballet Shoes hidden in the center of the grass and pick them up. Equip the Ballet Shoes (if you used the phone for the Sea-grass Skip, remember to menu back to Items and avoid making an accidental phone call). After doing so, go back right and exit to the right.

If you are having a hard time managing your health through enemy encounters, this makes for an opportune time to equip the Tutu as well. If you're only using the Tutu for Undyne, wait until just before her battle.
Go down and right once returning to the room. After reaching a turn that leads upward, you will get one of four encounters:

- Two Moldsmals. This is the optimal RNG and you have a 26.67% chance of getting this encounter. Both require a single, fairly accurate hit to kill.
- Woshua, Aaron. You have a 26.67% chance of getting this encounter. Kill the Woshua first by getting a very accurate hit (it doesn't need to be perfect, but should be pretty close). Then, endure Aaron's attack. Then, kill the Aaron using one of the following methods:
  - Hit Aaron with a very accurate hit followed by a semi-accurate hit.
  - Alternatively, if you are confident in your ability with the Ballet Shoes, you can ACT & select FLEX. Then get a very accurate hit to dispatch them on the next turn. This is slightly faster than attacking twice.
- Woshua. You have a 26.67% chance of getting this encounter as well. Dispatch the Woshua by getting a very accurate hit.
- Aaron. This is the worst RNG and thankfully you have only a 20% chance of getting this one. Dispatch him in the same manner as described above.

After killing your encounter, continue upwards and exit through the exit at the top.

In the Onion-san room, you won't encounter Onion-san. Just head right and exit into the next room.

The next room is the Shyren room. You will encounter Shyren right after moving up or down to navigate the square in the room. Once you encounter Shyren, FIGHT her and land a good, accurate hit to kill her in one attack. After killing Shyren, go right into the next room.

Walk right in the statue room and go to the next room.

Don't grab an Umbrella. Just walk right and exit into the next room.

In the first rainy hallway room, walk against the top wall while heading right. Mash Monster kid's text and continue heading right until the hallway turns and exit downwards.

In the second rainy hallway room, continue heading downwards and mash Monster Kid's text when they talk to you. Head right at the turn, mash Monster Kid's text again, and exit through the right.

In the room with the castle in the background, Wall Hump while moving right to gain a big speed boost. Exit through the right.

In the next room with the ledge, walk to the right and talk to Monster Kid. Mash their text and wait for the to tell you to climb onto their shoulders. While you wait for Monster Kid to let you climb up, you can drop the stick here and lose no time. Dropping the stick isn't necessary and is a community meme (but you will look super cool doing it). Mash their text once again and climb onto their shoulders to get onto the top of the ledge. Mash their text, head right and exit right.

Don't save in the next room. Keep walking right.

Continue walking right until you walk into the cutscene trigger. After the cutscene ends, complete the maze and go to the long bridge room.

The spears in the chase are fairly RNG-dependent, but you can easily manipulate where they appear. The game will try to predict where you will move and place the spears, however it won't account for if you're moving into a wall or anything. So move against a wall and hold the directional key to walk into the wall while still progressing. Once the spear placement has been chosen and they begin to appear, simply move off the wall and out of the way.

In the long bridge room after the chase, head right until the third set of spears fades away, turn around, and head left until you trigger the cutscene.

After falling from the bridge, you will get a short cutscene with unskippable text. Just mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

After waking up on the pile of golden flowers, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and exit right. In the room with the save, don't bother saving, keep going right.

Walk into the Glad Dummy room and walk upwards. You can stop by the orange cooler and get some astronaut food if you feel like you will need some healing items for Undyne (be aware that grabbing heals will waste time).

Walk into the Glad Dummy cutscene. Mash the text and begin the battle.

Once the battle begins, FIGHT them and land a semi-accurate hit on Glad Dummy to kill them. Depending on the encounter you got after grabbing the Ballet Shoes, you should now be at 6 or 7 kills. After the battle ends, exit upwards into the main hub room.

In the main hub room, walk right and exit right into Gerson's shop hallway.

In Gerson's shop hallway, walk right, go past the shop (unless you really need to buy safety items for Undyne), and exit right into the double waterfall hallway.

### Waterfall Grind & Undyne the Undying

Possible Random Encounters:

- Woshua, Moldbygg: 40%
- Woshua, Aaron: 33.33%
- Temmie: 26.67%

In the double waterfall hallway, walk right. You will encounter a Temmie in the room without having to grind. FIGHT the Temmie and kill her with a hit of any accuracy. After the encounter, approach the exit at the right. Before going forward into the next room, grind out an encounter with a scripted Moldsmal & Moldbygg. FIGHT & kill both of them. The Moldsmal should be fairly easy to kill in one turn, while the Moldbygg will require a fairly accurate hit to dispatch in one attack. After ending the encounter, exit into the Mushroom puzzle room on your right and grind out a scripted Woshua & Aaron encounter. FIGHT and kill them in the same manner described previously (after picking up the Ballet Shoes). After getting these kills, you should be at 11-12 kills. Transition back into the double waterfall room and grind for another encounter. Repeat this process until you have reached 14 or 15 kills. If you reach 14-15 kills in the mushroom puzzle room, quickly transition back into the double waterfall hallway and back out before continuing forward.

Moldbygg has the slowest attack in Waterfall. If you get the Moldbygg/Woshua encounter, be sure to menu down and attack the Moldbygg first for a little time save.
In the mushroom puzzle room, you don't actually need to light up the mushrooms to walk through the room. Look at the image below to see the path you will need to take. Grind out an encounter just before heading into the Lantern Room.

<img src='./Images/MushroomMaze.png' alt="Mushroom maze solution" title="Mushroom maze solution"></img>

In the lantern room, interact with the lamps as you pass them so you can see where you're going. You want to get the remaining kills in this room. You should be able to get an encounter before reaching the end of the room. If not, grind for an encounter before exiting into the next room. If you are not at 18 kills after this encounter, quickly enter and exit the next room and grind for another encounter. **DO NOT CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT ROOM UNTIL YOU HAVE 18 KILLS!** Once you have 18 kills total, exit into the “Behind You” flower room on the right at the end of the path.

In the “Behind you” flower room, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> when entering the room to put yourself against the wall. After putting yourself against the wall, just hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and mash. You want to talk to the “Behind you” flower as soon as possible and mash away the text. Mash all the text for the cutscene. After the cutscene is over, go left and head upwards onto the new path.

In the Flower hallway, save if you feel like there will be a chance of you dying. Go right into the Monster Kid bridge room once you are ready. If you haven't reached the kill requirement for Waterfall, “Strongly felt [X] left, Shouldn't proceed yet” will appear in red text. If this happens, you have miscounted and need to return to the lantern room and grind an encounter(s) until you've reached the kill requirement.

In the Monster Kid Bridge room, go right and hit the trigger for the cutscene. Mash all the text. Once the battle begins, FIGHT and hit Monster Kid as soon as possible (accuracy does not matter). Mash the battle cutscene and your battle with Undyne the Undying begins.

Undyne the Undying is the hardest enemy in the Genocide speedrun for two reasons.

1. You are required to land perfect hits with the Ballet Shoes in order to get the Undyne Quick Kill. By averaging around 1650 damage throughout the entire battle, you can skip one of Undyne's longer attack phases. You can afford to miss 12 perfect hits before you are unable to get the quick kill. The non-perfect hits also need to be very accurate hits. Healing will cause you to not be able to get the quick kill.
2. Getting hit actually causes the attacks to slow down. This means Undyne's battle is the only fight in the game where a no-hit saves time. Avoid getting hit as much as possible.

A lot of practice is recommended, as beating Undyne the Undying perfectly is very difficult.

For the entirety of the fight, you should just be FIGHTing Undyne and trying to land perfect hits. You can heal, just be aware that healing will waste a considerable amount of time.

Undyne the Undying's attacks have very little RNG in them. You will learn her attack patterns with practice.

After defeating Undyne the Undying, mash her death cutscene. Proceed to the right. Once you reach the Arena room, go into the rock structure at the top of the room. Walk up in the first hallway, walk right in the 2nd hallway, and continue walking right across the Hotland bridge & water cooler room. Continue to head right to enter into Hotland.

## Hotland

> Kills Required: 5

### The Lab & Early Pan

Don't bother using the save point unless you're in desperate need of heals. Walk right and enter the lab.

There is a glitch you can do to get the Burnt Pan in the lab called Early Burnt Pan. If you don't want to do the Early Burnt Pan glitch or would rather use the Empty Gun, simply walk to the right, grab Instant Noodles from the fridge, and mash through the cutscene. Exit the lab through the right exit.

EBP involves utilizing the old lab skip and overflowing on the fridge without the use of overflowing with a Punch Card.

Walk to the right of the dog food bag. Hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> and <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> when you're to the right of the dog food bag. Next hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> while still holding <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> and <kbd>◀ Left</kbd>. You should be right next to the trigger. Open your menu. You can let go of the arrow keys once your menu is open. Next, you will need to press <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Z</kbd> on consecutive frames. This is just like overflowing with the Punch Card. If done correctly, the text box should come up and the cutscene should start. Close the text box to regain movement.

After that, walk to the fridge and wait for Mettaton to say something. Mash that first bit of text. Your character will move to the right, and it will appear that you can't move, but you actually can move - you're just invisible. Interact with the fridge and press <kbd>X</kbd> to skip the text. You'll then want to listen for further text sounds. When you hear more text sounds, mash some more. Once Mettaton exits to the right, the cutscene will end, and you should have the Burnt Pan & Instant Noodles in your inventory. If you mashed quickly enough, you may notice you have regained movement and still have a textbox from the fridge open. You can use this to OWW into the next room to save a little bit of time. Alternatively, you can use/drop the stick while the camera is panning back to you to get text storage off of that as well.

After getting the Burnt Pan, exit the lab through the right exit. You may choose to equip the Burnt Pan before leaving the lab (for a more reliable kill on Tsunderplane), but this is slightly slower than using the Ballet Shoes.

### The beginning of Hotland

In the hallway after the lab, go right and go up at the turn. Exit through the exit at the top.

In the treadmill hallway room, take the left path. You will encounter Vulkin in the middle-ish of the room. FIGHT Vulkin and land a semi-accurate hit on them to one-hit kill them. Go up after the encounter and exit through the top exit.

In the first room with the set of vents, head to the bottom right of the room to grab the Burnt Pan (unless you did EBP or you'd rather use the Empty Gun). Somewhere in the process of this you will encounter Tsunderplane. Land a very accurate hit on them to one-hit kill them. After you grab the Burnt Pan, exit the main vent room through the top exit.

In the laser hallway, the lasers should be disabled. Simply walk right through the hallway and exit right.

In the next room, go right and go up at the turn. Use the vent when it faces upwards. Enter the doorway at the top of the room.

### Royal Guards

In the next room you will encounter the royal guards. Mash their text and begin the battle. FIGHT one of them and land fairly accurate hits to one-hit kill them. Endure an attack. FIGHT and kill the other one with a fairly accurate hit. The Royal Guards count towards the kill count.

After killing the Royal Guards, ride the vents and exit through the right.

In the next few rooms just hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>. Once you arrive at the elevator, interact with the door and go inside. Interact with the elevator interface and go to left floor 3.

In the room you arrive at, go right. In the next room, go right again and exit right.

Once you arrive at the room with the vents, ride the vents and go to the right. Once you arrive at the long platform at the right of the room, go right and go up at the turn. Go inside the doorway at the end of the platform. 

There is an OWW you can perform on the doorway that is incredibly risky and carries a high risk of softlocking the game. To perform the OWW, line up Frisk with the transition (their feet will be lined up with the thin line on the floor), press <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> & <kbd>◀ Left</kbd>/<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> (whichever direction the door is from where you lined up) into the transition & interact with the door at the same time, close the textbox quickly, and release the arrow keys. If done correctly, you should spawn directly below the save point in the next room. If you do not close the textbox in time, you will softlock. Be careful when you close the textbox to not accidentally interact with the door a second time, as you will softlock.

</div>

In the room before Muffet's spider lair, save if you really need heals. Go right and enter the doorway to the right.

### Muffet

Go right and dodge the spider webs. Mash the text. Walk onto the unavoidable spider webs. Keep mashing text. When you reach the center of the web (where you're prevented from moving), don't press any arrow keys as this will cause Muffet to appear later. Just hold still and wait.

Once Muffet appears, mash her text and begin the battle.

FIGHT Muffet. You need an accurate hit to one-hit kill her. After killing her, watch the long boring cutscene. After the battle is over, go right and exit right.

You should equip the Burnt Pan after Muffet.

Once you exit the spider lair, go right in the room with the poster. In the next room, go right once again. In the room with the stairs at the top of the room, go onto the stairs and exit through the top.

In the Hotel entrance room, if you got the Burnt Pan, walk to the big doors and enter the hotel.

If you prefer to use the Empty Gun instead of the Burnt Pan, go right to the alleyway and go into the alleyway. Go into the alleyway shop. Steal the Cowboy Hat and the Empty Gun from the shop. Leave the shop. Equip the Cowboy Hat and the Empty Gun (note: Like the Tutu, equipping the Cowboy Hat will make it less likely to successfully FLEE from an encounter). Go down the alleyway, go left and enter the doors of the hotel.

Inside the Hotel, go up and left around the fountain. Exit through the exit at the top of the room. If you *really* need heals for Sans, grab some at Burgerpants' shop before leaving the hotel.

In the Core transition room, go up and enter the Core.

## Core

> Kills required: 35

Possible Random Encounters:

- Whimsalot, Final Froggit: 20%
- Whimsalot, Astigmatism: 20%
- Knight Knight, Madjick: 20%
- Final Froggit, Astigmatism: 13.33%
- Final Froggit, Astigmatism, Whimsalot: 13.33%
- Knight Knight: 6.67%
- Madjick: 6.67%

You will need to get 35 kills in the Core. Note that Core shares a kill counter with Hotland for a total of 40 kills, but since you'll always start Core at 5 kills, many runners choose to count the 35 Core kills separately and so that is the convention used by this guide.

Go up to the elevator. Interact with the elevator to open the door. Go inside the elevator.

After exiting the Elevator, save at the save point to the right if you think you might die to the enemies in the Core or need a quick heal. After saving (or not), exit left onto the bridge hallway.

In the hallway with the bridge, immediately begin grinding & killing encounters. This will be your grinding spot until you reach 25 kills. The first five encounters are scripted and you do not need to worry about the RNG here.

- The triple encounter is the most preferable one.
- The double encounter with the Astigmatism and/or Whimsalot and/or Final Froggit are the 2nd best encounters. These monsters will require only very accurate hits to one-hit kill. (Astigmatism will require 2 perfect hits with the Empty Gun and 3 perfect hits with the Pan. Final Froggit / Whimsalot will require 1 or 2 perfect hits or 4 very accurate hits).
- The other double encounter contains a Madjick and a Knight Knight. A Knight Knight requires a perfect hit with the Empty Gun or Burnt Pan to one-hit kill. A Madjick doesn't require a perfect hit (with the gun), but it will still require an extremely accurate hit to one-hit kill (3 perfect and 1 accurate hits with the Empty Gun, 4 perfect hits with the Burnt Pan). For a Knight Knight/Madjick fight, it is slightly faster to kill the Madjick before killing the Knight Knight.
- The single encounters contain a lone Madjick or Knight Knight. This is the worst encounter you can receive.
- Using the save point to heal if you get hurt really badly isn't a bad idea. Dying loses more time than healing.

Once you have at least 20 kills, go across the bridge, and grind out another encounter. After killing that encounter, exit into the next hallway, go left and up to exit into the next room.

In this room, grind out another encounter. You don't want to progress onto the warrior's path until you have at least 27 kills. If you do not have at least 27 kills after your encounter in this room, transition and grind for another. If you encounter enough monsters to get to 28 kills from a single encounter, get to 28 kills and then flee the remaining monsters and move on to the warrior's path. If you have exactly 27 kills after a battle ends, move on to the warrior's path anyway; you'll grind out one more monster afterwards.

After getting 27 or more kills, go into the room to the left, and then go up into the warrior's path. In the warrior's path, trigger the scripted encounters by walking down the bridge. You will get three encounters, with 7 monsters total. Kill as many as you need (Note: You can't flee from these battles) to obtain 35 kills if you went to Warrior's Path at 28 kills or 34 kills if you went to Warrior's Path at 27 kills. If your last kill is in the Warrior's Path (i.e. you entered Warrior's Path at 28 kills), it is optimal to equip the Ballet Shoes for the final encounter on the Warrior's Path, however it will require two perfect hits and a very, very accurate third hit (one frame off is allowed) to kill the Astigmatism in one hit. Only do this if you are very confident in your abilities with the Ballet Shoes.

Once you kill all 7 Warrior's Path monsters, begin to head back to the room with Mettaton's door. If you have 35 kills, you will get the “But nobody came…” encounters on your way back. If you have 34 kills, you will not get these encounters and you must grind out an encounter at the end of the final bridge. Kill one monster in this encounter and flee the rest. This will bring your kill count up to 35 kills.

With the kills you got in Hotland, you should have 40 kills total. After getting the necessary kills, equip the Ballet Shoes (if you had not done so earlier) and return to the room with Mettaton's door (the same room you went into after using the elevator). From this point on your damage won't matter. The Ballet Shoes have a much faster attack animation, so using the Ballet Shoes instead of the Empty Gun/Burnt Pan for the fights ahead will save around 8 seconds.

If you suspect you may have miscounted, you can access the save point to see how many kills you have left, and then get the necessary kills.

Enter the colorful doorway in the room with the savepoint after getting the right amount of kills.

### Mettaton NEO

Once you enter the room, walk up and trigger the cutscene with Mettaton (make sure you have the Ballet Shoes equipped). Once the battle begins, FIGHT and hit Mettaton as soon as possible. Your accuracy doesn't matter. Mash the text after hitting Mettaton. After the battle, head up and enter the doorway at the top of the room.

In the long hallway, go up and go right at the turn. Keep going right until you reach the elevator. Interact with the elevator to open it and walk inside.

Inside the elevator, interact with the interface. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and wait for the elevator to reach the top. Once the door opens you should move down if you are holding <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>. Exit the elevator

If you are running on the Nintendo Switch, you can perform the Long Elevator skip by simply entering the elevator and immediately exiting. No need to interact with the interface at all.

In the hallway outside the elevator, go right and go up at the turn. Enter the next hallway.

In the next hallway, go up and go right at the turn. Enter the room to the right.

In the last hallway before entering New Home, go right and go up at the turn. Enter the front yard of New Home.

In the front yard of New Home, go up. If you are low on HP, you should use the savepoint in front of New Home as you pass it to heal up to full. After healing (or not), enter the doorway to New Home.

## New Home

> You're gonna have a bad time.

### FloweyTale

Once you enter New Home, go left and enter the dining room. Head towards the kitchen in the dining room. You will start getting encounters with Flowey. Mash away his text and end the encounters. Enter the kitchen, take the key, and return to the first room of New Home.

Go to the right and enter the hallway. Go straight for the key at the right end of the hallway. Grab the key and return to the first room of New Home. Do NOT grab the True Knife / Heart Locket, they will do nothing to help you in the Sans fight, and getting them is a waste of time.

Once you have both keys and have returned to first room, unlock the gate and go downstairs into the next set of hallways.

In the rest of the hallways of New Home, keep progressing down the hallways and mashing away Flowey's encounters. When you reach the end of the hallways, go down into Sans' judgement hallway.

Once you reach Sans' judgement hallway, use the savepoint and save if you think you will die to Sans. Make sure you have everything you will need. Once you are ready, go to the right and trigger Sans' cutscene.

Mash away Sans' text and begin the battle.

### Sans Battle

Realistically, to an experienced runner, this battle isn't much of a challenge. However, there are still plenty of ways to lose yourself and die to Sans. It's recommended that you practice this fight a lot beforehand.

To optimally defeat Sans, you want to FIGHT him each turn and hit him as soon as possible, accuracy is irrelevant. The only way to progress the battle is to FIGHT him. Taking a turn to heal will waste time by making you endure an extra attack. So simply keep FIGHTing him and hitting him as soon as you can, and don't die.

His first part will have 13 attacks, if you don't heal. After the first part, you will have an intermission. If you want to, you can heal during this intermission to waste only a little bit of time. After healing (or not), FIGHT him and hit him again to begin the 2nd part.

His 2nd part has 10 attacks if you don't heal. Simply endure these attacks and his final big attack. Don't die.

After the final big attack, keep mashing and wait out the last part of the battle. Don't touch the left wall of the frame until he's fully asleep. If you touch it, it will wake him back up, and you will have to wait for him to fall asleep again. Once he falls asleep, push the frame down to the FIGHT button and use it, and finish Sans. Mash the rest of the battle.

After the battle ends, go right and enter the doorway at the end of the hallway.

In the next hallway, go up and go right at the turn. Enter the doorway in the wall.

### The Finale

In Asgore's throne room, walk up and trigger the cutscene. You won't have to use the arrow keys for the rest of the run.

Mash Asgore's text. Once the battle begins, mash his text. Mash Flowey's text after Asgore dies. When Flowey dies, Chara will appear.

Chara talks very slowly. Incredibly slowly. You can't mash away their text but you want to end the text as soon as you can. So spam <kbd>Z</kbd> / <kbd>Enter</kbd> when the text is about to finish. Prepare your timer when the dialogue choice appears. Select ‘Erase’ or ‘Do not’ (which one you pick doesn't matter but ‘Erase’ will be faster to select).

***STOP YOUR TIMER WHEN YOU SELECT ‘ERASE’ OR ‘DO NOT’ ON CHARA'S DIALOGUE CHOICE!***
