# All Major Endings

<img src='./Images/UTSRGuidesHeader.png'></img>

## Introduction

All Major Endings is a very long marathon category. While the world record is around four and a half hours, a beginner runner can expect a time closer to six hours. It entails completing the Genocide, True Pacifist, and 8 different neutral endings. 

## Route Notes

### Preparation

It is recommended that runners be somewhat familiar with all 3 main runs of the game (Neutral, TPE, and Genocide) as many of the tricks and strategies are the same - the final part of the run is almost identical to a TPE run, and there is a large stretch in the middle that is highly similar to a Genocide run. Because there are many segments that are similar if not identical to one of these 3 routes, any segment like that will contain a brief overview and a link to the corresponding part of the relevant guides. This is done to prevent this document from being hundreds of pages long.

### Endings

You must complete at least one of each of the following Major Endings. The numbers in parentheses correspond to the ending numbers on this flowchart: https://imgur.com/6wNQy8i. These descriptions are weird and tehcnical because they are descriptions of the actual game code. 

#### True Pacifist Ending (65-68)

Complete any True Pacifist Ending.

#### Genocide Ending (90-93)

Complete any Genocide Ending.

#### Family Ending/Betrayed Undyne Ending (31-64)

Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Papyrus, and Undyne alive and less than 10 kills.

#### Exiled Queen Ending (5-30)

Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel alive and at least one of the following: 
- 10 or more kills
- Papyrus dead
- Undyne dead

####  Undyne Ending (69-74)

- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel dead and Undyne alive.

#### Mettaton Ending (75-80)

- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel and Undyne dead and Mettaton alive.

#### Papyrus Ending (81-85)

- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, and Mettaton dead and Papyrus alive.

#### Dog Ending (86)

- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus dead and exactly 4 kills (those kills being the aformentioned monsters).

#### No King Ending (87-88)

- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus dead, a murder level of less than 12, and a number of kills that is not 4. 

#### Alphys Ending (89)

- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus dead, and a murder level of 12 or higher.

### Branch Order

The run is made up of 3 different branches: the Genocide branch (Papyrus, Alphys, Genocide), Pacifist branch (Family, Exiled Queen, TPE), and Neutral branch (Undyne, Mettaton, Dog and No King).  This guide assumes you will be doing the branches in the order Genocide; Neutral; Pacifist. It is possible to swap the order of these branches with only minimal routing changes, however having the genocide branch first will save a few seconds due to avoiding a cutscene with Flowey, as well as potentially saving a turn on Mettaton depending on RNG. 

### Saving

The reason this run is 4 hours long instead of 10 is due to a large amount of routing around **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** points. A key strategy in this route is to save the game, get one ending, then reload to that save point and get another ending. Unfortunately this means that after certain points in the run, you will not be able to SAVE, and doing so will lose anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Any time where you will need to save the game will be marked like this: **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>**. After that point, until you reload to that save, you should not save again.

## Papyrus Ending

> In the Papyrus ending, we will first start a genocide route to gain EXP for bosses later on. We will then save before Papyrus so we can reload and finish genocide later. 

Requirements: 
- Toriel Dead
- Papyrus Alive
- Undyne Dead
- Mettaton Dead

### Ruins

Ruins routing is identical to genocide. For in-depth details check out the [Genocide Guide](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Genocide?id=Ruins "UTSR Guides - Genocide").

Overview:
- Goal is 20 Kills
- If you don't do Toriel Ass Warp, kill the first froggit. It does not count towards the kill counter for Ruins.
- Kill 11 enemies alternating between the Leaf Pile room and the room after it. These enemies will randomly be either Froggits or Whimsuns, with Froggits being the slower option.
- Kill a 12th enemy on th eright side of the room after Leaf Pile. 
- Kill a 13th enemy in the One Rock Room.
- Grind to all 20 kills in the 3 rock room, leaving and entering each time. Encounters can be Froggit/Whimsun, triple Moldsmall, single Moldsmall, double Moldsmall, or double froggit.
- Continue through ruins normally. You will know you are on the Genocide route if Napstablook disappears.
- Do not get the Toy Knife, it is useless.
- If you need the pie as healing for sans or UTU, you can grab it if you'd like.
- Fight and Kill Toriel, she should die in one shot.

### Snowdin

Snowdin is the point in our run where we will diverge from the genocide route. Unfortunately, we are not able to kill all of the monsters in Snowdin because doing so would make the Nice Cream Man disappear, forcing us to complete Genocide without the punch card. Because of this, we will save immediately before exhausting the Snowdin kill count, then continue on with the papyrus ending.

#### Snowdin Forest

Walk right down the long hallway, be prepared to mash when you meet Sans. You will enter a cutscene with Sans and Papyrus talking. Mash all of their text. After the cutscene, continue right. Sans will talk again right before leaving the room, so prepare to mash again.

In the next room, interact with the save point to bring your health back to full. You will need to have health for a skip later in the game. 

After interacting with the save point, go over to the box and take out the tough glove. If you have the pie, put it in the box first and then take everything out. This ensures that the pie is the 2nd item in your inventory. Open your menu and equip the tough glove. This will put the stick in the first inventory slot. Grind out your first kill on the right side of the room. It will be a guaranteed snowdrake.  Continue to the next room.

Mash through the next cutscene, and continue along the path.

There is an 11% chance to get a phone call somewhere in the middle of the path that wastes time. Prepare to mash in case you get the phone call.

There is also an unavoidable encounter in the room. This encounter is guaranteed to be an ice cap. Kill it (2 TOTAL KILLS). After Ice Cap, proceed to Doggo.

Doggo **does not count** towards the Snowdin kill count, however killing him is necessary to complete geno. Hit him twice to kill him.

Getting hit by Doggo's attack as soon as possible by holding right is the fastest option.

#### Papyrus' Puzzles...?

In the room with the frozen pond, do not slide across the ice. Instead, encounter Lesser Dog. Kill it. It is slightly faster to pet it first to lower it's defense, and then kill it (3 TOTAL KILLS).

If you would like the Snowman Pieces as healing items for Sans or UTU, grab them. Make sure you grind out Lesser dog before entering the upper room, and then grind out another encounter, which will be a guaranteed Ice Cap. Kill it and remember that you have an extra kill.

In the room with the ball game, cross the bridge and continue down and to the right, making sure to not get stuck on the snowdecahedron.

In the next room, go right then mash when the cutscene starts. Walk past the paper on the ground. Mash through the cutscene, then continue right into the next room.

Continue right through the room with the cold spaghetti. Don’t bother saving, as it only loses time.

In the snow puzzle room, the switch in the top right will already be pressed. Head straight down to the Dogi. You will get an encounter on the way. It will either be an Ice Cap and Jerry, or an Ice Cap, Chilldrake, and Jerry. Kill the Ice Cap and the Chilldrake if there is one, but flee from Jerry. He isn't worth your time. At this point you will have anywhere from 4 to 6 Kills.

After this, kill the Dogi. Be sure to kill Dogaresa first. The Dogi **DO NOT COUNT** towards the kill count.

You can continue thorough both XO puzzle rooms without worry, they are already solved for you. Similarly, the colored tile puzzle will not activate so you can simply mash through it.

The ice puzzle is also already solved for you, so simply head towards the bridge and continue onward.

Finally, there is the snow poff room and greater dog. Kill him. **HE DOES NOT COUNT** towards the kill count.

#### The Snowdin Grind

Activate the Gauntlet of Deadly Terror cutscene and mash it. Once it's done, immediately exit on the *left side of the room*. Return and start the Snowdin grind. Make sure to leave and reenter after every encounter.

You cannot finish the Snowdin kill grind. If you do, you will not be able to obtain the punch card later on in the Papyrus Ending. Instead, you want to stop the grind right before reasching the correct number of kills. Once your kill count is at or above 11, you want to cross to the right side of the bridge, and grind out 1 more encounter. This will take you to anywhere from 12 to 14 kills. At this point, head into town and **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>**. This is the longest instance of going without a save in the run. From here on out, you are not able to save the game. This makes softlocks particularly dangerous, so it is recommended to be relatively conservative with which tricks you attempt during this part of the run.

Continue onwards and fight Papyrus. You will want to spare him, however the fastest way to get him to a sparable state is to FIGHT him until his HP gets low. On the first attack of the Papyrus fight, you can take intentional damage to cause the first attack to repeat, skipping a slower attack later on. Hit Papyrus with accurate hits until he uses his special attack. At this point, spare him. He will use his Really Cool Regular Attack. After this, he will grant you mercy, and you can spare him again to finish the fight.

### Waterfall

#### The Beginning of Waterfall

In the Waterfall and falling rocks room, hold right until you get to the middle of the waterfall, then press up a bit and go back down a bit when you’re about to reach the end of the waterfall.

In the next room, perform [Sea Grass Skip](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Waterfall "UTSR Guides - Neutral") as you normally would. Continue as normal through the 2 bridge puzzle rooms, the telescope room, spears 1, and Gaster. Dropping the stick is an option, but only really worth doing if you don't have any healing items.

#### The Punch Card and Ballet Shoes

If you are on versions 1.02+, go to the punch card room, grab the punch card as normal, then go to the ballet shoes room and grab the ballet shoes.

If you are on versions 1.0-1.001, there is a faster strategy you can do called Early Ballet shoes. First, put all your items (if you have any) in the box. Then go to the punch card room and buy *two* nice creams. Eat them both, and take one punch card out of the box. Overflow the box, and you will get a set of Ballet Shoes. Equip them. You can leave your stuff in the box if you want, you don't really need any of it for this ending.

Regardless, continue onwards, as you would in neutral, through the Onionsans room, monster kid rooms, and spears 2.

#### Mad Dummy

Because Mad Dummy Skip requires a save, you cannot do it during this ending. Instead, you have to do the older 5-cycle strat. If you're particularly used to mad dummy skip, the astronaut food provides a convenient healing source that only loses a handful of frames. 

Walk into the Mad Dummy cutscene. If you'd like, you can do something similar to the first part of the mad dummy skip, where you walk downwards to scroll the screen. However this doesn't save very much time at all and requires a particularly quick overflow.

Mash the text from the Mad Dummy cutscene and begin the battle.

Once the battle begins, move to MERCY and Spare the Mad Dummy. You will do this action for the rest of the battle.

In the first phase of the Mad Dummy fight, you are trying to deal as much damage to Mad Dummy using the Dummy’s cotton balls.

There is a way to complete the first phase of Mad Dummy in 5 attacks. Consult the photo below to see how to complete the fight in the minimum attacks.

<img src='./Images/5CycleMadDummy.png' alt="5 cycle Mad Dummy positions" title="5 cycle Mad Dummy positions"></img>

You don’t need to hit the dummy in the rocket stages. After the battle, mash Napstablook’s text and proceed upwards.

After this, continue through waterfall as normal. The most important skips and tricks will be recapped here. For more details, consult [the Neutral Guide](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Waterfall "UTSR Guides - Neutral").

#### Napstablook Skip

This skip can be performed fairly quickly right after entering the room. PCE the trigger for Napstablook. After PCEing the trigger, move up and right, and then move right and exit to Gerson’s shop hallway.

<img src='./Images/NapstablookSkip.png' alt="Napstablook Skip PCE" title="Napstablook Skip PCE"></img>

Alternatively, you can wrong warp into the room and open your punch card before the cutscene activates. You will gain movement back again after closing the punch card again. This method is slightly faster.

With both methods, you can also use the few moments where Napstablook is leaving the room to wrong warp in the next room. After getting the skip, go right, mash 3 lines of text, then mash the last line of text after you walk a little bit past the sign. Hold up and right as you enter the transition, and let go afterward to perform the wrong warp.

#### The EXP Check (IMPORTANT)

At some point during Waterfall, you need to check what your EXP is. This route has you very close to saving a turn on Mettaton, so to save that turn you need to buff your attack. The two ways to do this are to kill Vulkin and to buy and use a Legendary Hero.

- If you currently have 630 EXP or more, then killing Vulkin is the fastest way to buff your attack.
- If you currently have 629 EXP or fewer, then killing Vulkin will not work and you will have to buy a Legendary hero anyway.
- Alternatively, buying a legendary hero always works and loses less than a second if you do it when you don't have to.

Remember for later whether your EXP was high or low. 

#### Flowerflow

In the next room, a somewhat complicated trick called flowerflow is used to shorten the distance needed to walk after the cutscene. Overflow the flower, close the punch card, then open the punch card again while also closing the “Behind You” text. This is done by X and then Enter (or otherwise any button to finish text followed by a button to close the text) in the window where you cannot close the punch card. Next walk towards the left of the room. Be careful not to walk too far that the screen scrolls or the part in the cutscene where Undyne carries Monster Kid away will be longer. Open your menu, ready to use the punch card. You can also use the cell phone instead, which is slightly easier. When undyne starts talking, use the punch card or cell phone and mash through her text. After Undyne has finished talking, quickly reopen the punch card/cell phone. If you do not open the punch card or cell phone fast enough, you will lose movement. Wait for monster kid to start talking and mash away the punch card/cell phone and continue mashing away text in the rest of the cutscene.

Once the cutscene is over, walk left to where the path upwards will be. Optionally, you can info the punch card near the end of this part so that when the path appears, you will have text storage and will be able to OWW to the next room. Otherwise, wrong warp normally into the next room.

If you fail any part of flowerflow, continue mashing away the rest of the cutscene normally. Flowerflow saves 5 seconds.

</div>

#### Monster Kid Bridge Skip

In the Monster Kid Bridge room, PCE the trigger for the cutscene. The trigger is near the last support of the bridge. NOTE: If you wrong warped into the room, you will hit the trigger at a slightly different place than if you just walked into the room. After PCEing the cutscene, walk to the right and go to the next room.

This is the trigger if you wrong warped into the room as most runners do. If you do not wrong warp into the room, the trigger will be 1 pixel to the right.

<img src='./Images/MonsterKidBridgeSkip.png' alt="Monster Kid Bridge Skip trigger" title="Monster Kid Bridge Skip trigger"></img>

You can walk back out of the room after the Monster Kid Bridge skip and wrong warp back in to save a tiny bit of time.

#### Undyne

There are a variety of different ways to shorten or the Undyne boss fight, just like in Neutral - however the options are a little bit different. 

First Trigger:

<img src='./Images/UndyneFirstTrigger.png' alt="Undyne first trigger" title="Undyne first trigger"></img>

Second Trigger:

<img src='./Images/UndyneSecondTrigger.png' alt="Undyne second trigger" title="Undyne second trigger"></img>

Wrong Warp Position:

<img src='./Images/UndyneWrongWarp.png' alt="Undyne wrong warp position" title="Undyne wrong warp position"></img>

##### Method 1 (easiest)

Run into both triggers, as you would in glitchless.

##### Method 2 (easy)

PCE the first trigger, then run into the second trigger. This will save just a couple of seconds over method 1.

##### Method 3 (medium)

PCE the first trigger, quickly PCE the second trigger, then walk into the second room. Let Undyne catch you, then kill her. Go back down to the first room and wrong warp into the second room. This saves about 20 seconds over method 3.

##### Method 4 (hard)

This is the same as Onedyne in neutral. If you already know onedyne, you should continue to implement it here, but if not I would just stick to method 3 which is only slightly slower. 

Walk into the room and begin moving up the path. PCE the first trigger. You will need to PCE the second trigger extremely quickly after PCEing the first to pull this off. After PCEing the 2nd trigger, PCA Undyne’s text and mash it until you get to the “Here I come” text. This text will disappear 30 frames after it appears, and you will want to be in the room transition when the text disappears. After this, walk through the second room. Continue onto the third room, walk right until undyne catches you, and then kill her. This method saves a few seconds over method 3. A video guide for this method can be seen below.

<div style=" max-width: 1280px; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: flex;">
    <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-AYXP8BQszo" title="Onedyne guide by Shayy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

#### Undyne Part 2

In terms of actually killing Undyne, there aren't really any tips. The arrow attacks are the same every time so you can memorize them, but other than that you just want to hit her with the ballet shoes until she dies. Once you get her health down to 0 and she starts shimmering, that is effectively a cutscene and you can switch to sparing her.

There is a harder strat called Pacifist Kindergarten. To perform pacifist kindergarten, you will do a variant on the kindergarten strat. This variant is significantly easier than the strategy in TPE because you have much more HP. Undyne is programmed so that if after a certain number of turns she hasn't been damaged, she will drop her defense significantly. It ends up being about 15 seconds faster to trigger this state if you use Kindergarten to trigger it more quickly. To perform the strat, do the following.

- Challenge Undyne four times, getting hit by one of her bullets each time.
- Spare Undyne and dodge the difficult "Kindergarten" attack
- Continue to spare Undyne (do not flee) through the red soul phase and the following green soul phase
- Once the last green soul phase ends, spare her one more time
- Undyne's defense has dropped and you are now able to do 330 damage to her with a triple. Continue to fight her until she reaches 0 HP and starts her dying cutscene
- Switch back to sparing Undyne while her death cutscene plays

There are more wrong warps you can do after Undyne, but they only save a small amount of time. 

### Hotland

Get very used to doing hotland. You will pass through hotland a bunch during the game, and it's always the same as Neutral.

If I transcribed the whole Hotland section over from neutral every time, this guide would be extremely long. [Here's the link](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Hotland "UTSR Guides - Neutral") to the Neutral guide's section on Hotland.

When you encounter Vulkin, kill it if your EXP was HIGH (>=630). You should level up. If you don't, you misremembered your EXP and will have to buy a Hero later.

After activating the first cutscene in Core, but before getting your menu back, go to the Burgerpants shop and buy a Legendary Hero if your EXP was LOW (<630). If you didn't check your EXP or don't remember what it was, it loses around 2 seconds to just buy the hero every time.

#### Mettaton

Mettaton consists of two phases. During the first phase, Mettaton is invulnerable. Once you hit the second phase he will be vulnerable to attack.  Before the fight, you can PCE the trigger and walk to the other side of the room, but this can be slightly difficult as there's a chance the moving platform will push you out of the room. Once Mettaton says "Attack of the killer robot!", clear that text and then open the punch card.

##### First Phase

- During the first attack, SPARE. Mash through the text, but be careful not to overmash and shoot mettaton. Shooting mettaton loses time.
- During the second attack, SPARE and don't get hit.
- During the third attack, SPARE and don't get hit.
- During the fourth attack, SPARE and don't get hit. The fourth attack will be the first one to have a bomb. 
- For the fifth attack, if you have a legendary hero, you should use it now. Otherwise, SPARE again.
- Finally for the sixth attack, ACT and select the "Yellow" option and the fight will begin.

##### Second Phase.

- During the second attack, robots will rain down from the screen. Try to destroy them all if you can, this will shorten the turns.
- Attack 4 also has robots, again try to destroy them all.
- Attack 5 is an essay. It is slightly faster to type one character, but it is slightly more fun to type memes.
- Attack 6 involves mettaton's heart. Hit it as much as you can while staying alive to try and make the turn end faster. 
- Attack 7 is just a whole bunch of robots. Try to destroy them all.

A perfect fight will end after attack 5. It is always faster to destroy robots when they appear, and to get as many hits on Mettaton's heart as possible when it appears.

Once Mettaton is over, you will have the punch card open. Wait until Alphys starts talking, then close it and leaves the room.

#### Alphys Elevator Skip.

In All Major Endings, there are some endings where Alphys Elevator skip must be done, some where it must not be done, and some where it doesn't matter. In this ending, it doesn't matter. I would still recommend doing it because it's fast, but don't worry if you miss it. Here is the description:

This is one of the most difficult PCEs in the run because of how inconsistent it is and that there is no clear visual indicator. Once you enter the hallway after Mettaton, hold up and right. Move down the hallway. Wait for the lights on the wall to go dark twice. Once they have done that, the lights will brighten up. Once the lights start to dim down from their brightest state, you will hit the trigger. The best visual indicator is the pattern along the left edge of the screen. This is a repeating pattern, but it will look like the image below when you hit the trigger.

<img src='./Images/AlphysElevatorSkip.png' alt="Alphys Skip trigger location" title="Alphys Skip trigger location"></img>

Once you PCE the trigger, continue to the right. As soon as Alphys begins to speak, PCA her textbox by opening and closing another punch card, but do not advance past her first textbox. When you get to the elevator, interact with it once with Z and do not mash until you see Alphys’s face appear. When Alphys’s face appears, mash the text and enter the elevator.

There’s a slightly faster version of this skip that involves clearing the textbox slightly earlier. Press Z slightly before reaching the elevator door, then press Z on the elevator door, then X, then wait half a second and press Z again while holding up. Make sure you’re not touching the walls of the elevator door when you enter it or you’ll softlock.

#### Long Elevator skip.

You can do long elevator skip like normal, but since you're still in no-save, there is another option. If after doing long elevator skip, you reenter the elevator, then ride it down and back up glitchless, this will create an autosave, which you will reload to if you die to Asgore. This takes a long time, so it's not recommended, but it is an option if you struggle with Asgore. 

### New Home

The first New Home of the run is the same boring slog as in Neutral. Subsequent New Homes are different, and I will describe those differences when we get to them. For now though, just do what you would do in a Neutral run.

#### Judgement Hall

Judgement hall is a little bit different. You want to walk right in the Judgement hallway, and PCE the trigger for the cutscene like normal. After doing that, quickly close the Punch Card and walk right. Keep holding right until Sans’ silhouette is fully visible.

This is the key difference. Once his silhouette is fully visible, stop holding right. Wait for sans to start talking. Once you see the first textbox, hold up-right. This will set a flag that lets you skip Sans dialogue later on in the game.

### Flowey

Beyond this, Asgore and Flowey are the same as in neutral. Asgore is slightly faster since you're higher LV, but Flowey is literally identical (the Neutral and All Major Endings TASes use the same inputs). Once you've finished the flowey fight, be sure to wait until you see the Undertale logo before closing the game, as you would in TPE. Otherwise, you'll have to fight flowey again later which loses 10 minutes.

## Alphys Ending

> The Alphys Ending is the bulk of the genocide route, with genocide aborted at the last minute to get this neutral ending. Expect to basically be following the genocide route.

Requirements:
- Murder Level of 12 or higher (Undyne the Undying Dead)
- Mettaton Dead

### Snowdin

Remember how many kills you had last time you saved, or if you don't, check the save point for a reminder.

You will have anywhere from 2 to 4 kills left. Here are all the possibilities:

#### 4 kills left (12 done)

- double: kill ice cap, check 3 kills section
- triple: kill ice cap and chilldrake, check 2 kills section

#### 3 kills left (13 done)

- double: kill ice cap, flee jerry, check 2 kills section
- triple: kill all 3 monsters

#### 2 kills left (14 done)

- double: kill both monsters
- triple: kill Ice Cap and Chilldrake, flee Jerry.

After this, continue on to the Papyrus fight and kick his butt into the stratosphere.

### Waterfall

Waterfall has a handfull of different routes that make effectively summarizing it difficult. Consult the [Genocide guide](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Genocide?id=Waterfall "UTSR Guides - Genocide") for more information.

### Hotland

The route through hotland is the same as the geno route. As a recap
- Perform Early Burnt Pan.
- Kill Vulkin
- Kill Tsunderplane
- Kill Royal Guards
- Kill Muffet 

### Core

For CORE, you want to go straight to the bridge and start grinding out encounters. You will get the following scripted encounters
- Astigmatism
- Froggit + Whimsun
- Whimsun + Astigmatsim
- Froggit + Astigmatism
- Knight Knight + Madjick
After this, you are at 9 kills and want to grind until you have at least 20. At that point, remember how many kills you have. **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** in Core End. Continue to Mettaton NEO. Kill him and mash his text. 

### New Home

New home is the same as neutral/TPE glitchless, except with mashable text in monstertale/judgment hall. No other diffrences.

### Flowey

After killing Asgore, instead of fighting Flowey like normal, Flowey will give you some dialog and drop you into the final room of the game. Walk towards the door again. You once again want to wait until the title screen appears because doing so will shorten Flowey's dialog later on. 

## Genocide Ending.

> The Genocide Ending is the end of the genocide route. It consists of a few monster kills followed by the intense Sans fight.

### Core

This route lets you reload to the genocide route right before you would cross over to the left side of the bridge. The rest of the genocide ending looks like this:
- 1 encounter on the left side of the bridge
- Grind encounters in the room exactly halfway between the Warrior's path and the bridge until you are at either 27 or 28 kills. If you are at 26 kills and get a triple, kill 2 monsters and then flee.
- Complete the Warrior's path. You should have 34 or 35 kills
- If you don't have all 35 kills, grind an encounter on the right side of the bridge on the way back to NEO.
- Fight NEO
- Fight Sans
- Fight Asgore

### End

Once you finish mashing the incredibly slow Chara cutscene, you are able to reload as soon as you select "ERASE" or "DO NOT". This allows you to reload before Chara erases the world, saving about 10 minutes. **DO NOT LET CHARA ERASE THE WORLD**.

## Undyne Ending

> The Undyne Ending is the first ending to broadly follow the neutral route, though the handful of kills done makes it more similar to the Dog Ending category.

Requirements:
- Undyne Alive
- Toriel Dead

### Ruins

Reset the game by selecting the "Reset" option instead of the "Continue" option in the menu. You will then load into a fresh save of the game. Continue through ruins as you normally would in a neutral run, with the following exceptions:
- In the first room of Ruins, flowey will not be there to talk to you. Instead, when you run into the cutscene trigger, Toriel will appear. Mash through her text.
- Some dialogue will be different, however this will not affect your run. 
- Because we will be doing Dog Ending on this save file later on, you should **NOT** kill any enemies except for Toriel and Papyrus until you save for the last time. 
- Instead of sparing Toriel, kill her. 

#### Toriel Kill

Toriel has many different attacks, but there are 2 we’ll be looking for: her hand attacks. You’ll want to run into the hands as soon as possible, since running into them ends the turn immediately, saving time. Each hand saves about 5 seconds.

The entire battle is 13 turns long, but the 13th turn is always harmless so realistically it’s only 12 turns long. You can get 6 non-hand attacks before losing time.

A good strategy is to count the turns in your head. When you’re at the later turns and your HP is still pretty high, start taking damage. The goal is to be at 3 HP entering the 12th turn, since getting hit at 3 HP also causes a turn cancel. Don’t worry about this if she’s giving you lots of hands.

There’s also another strategy you can do to get 8 hands instead of 6. View the gif below.

<img src='./Images/8HandStrat.gif' alt='This attack deals 1hp, allowing for 8-hand Toriel strats.' title='This attack deals 1hp, allowing for 8-hand Toriel strats.'></img>

In this attack, the hitbox that spawns the fireballs is bigger than the actual fireballs. That means, with some careful positioning, you can take only 1 HP of damage. This allows you to get damaged by 2 more hand attacks, which saves around 10 seconds with good RNG. Note that this can only be done when you’re at 8 or higher HP, and it can only be done once. Doing it more than once is just a waste of health.

There is an even faster strategy that can potentially lead to 9 hands. Every time there’s a hand attack, there’s a 50/50 chance that a hand will spawn from the bottom. This hand does 3 damage instead of the usual 4. By hitting three bottom hands before reaching 7 or lower HP, you can get up to 9 hands total. If you only manage to hit two bottom hands, you still get a setup for 8 hands and if you only manage to hit one bottom hand, you get a setup for 7 hands. This is the most optimal way to do the Toriel fight RTA, if you’re able to react to the attack patterns fast enough.

This is all the same as Neutral. However, once Toriel says "I know you want to go home, but...", switch to the Fight" button and mash to kill her. Mash through her text and continue forward. 

You will not see Flowey at the end of ruins like you would normally. Simply walk through that room.

### Snowdin

Snowdin is another area that is virtually identical until the Papyrus fight. In this branch, you want to kill him instead.

### Papyrus Kill

The strategy for killing Papyrus optimally is rather counterintuitive. Papyrus is able to be "betrayal killed" after he does his really cool regular attack, allowing you to instantly one shot him. The goal of the fight is to activate the really cool regular attack as soon as possible. You do this by first triggering the special attack by attacking Papyrus until his health is low enough to activate the special attack early, then sparing him in between his special and really cool regular attacks because it's the fastest menu option, then finishing him off. In summary:
- Attack Papyrus until he does his special attack.
- Spare Papyrus once in between his special attack and really cool regular attack.
- Attack papyrus one final time after his really cool regular attack.

As previously described, you can take a hit from the first attack to save a small amount of time.

### Waterfall

#### The Beginning of Waterfall

In the Waterfall and falling rocks room, hold right until you get to the middle of the waterfall, then press up a bit and go back down a bit when you’re about to reach the end of the waterfall.

In the next room, perform [Sea Grass Skip](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Waterfall "UTSR Guides - Neutral") as you normally would. Continue as normal through the 2 bridge puzzle rooms, the telescope room, spears 1, and Gaster. On 1.0-1.001, the stick drop strats will save more time than they do in Neutral because you are doing Early Ballet Shoes.

#### The Punch Card and Ballet Shoes

Grab the punch card and Ballet Shoes just like you did during the Papyrus ending. After this, continue through the rest of Waterfall as you would in neutral. Unlike with the Papyrus Ending, there are no save requirements during this part of the game so you are free to perform Mad Dummy Skip if you would like.

#### Undyne Part 1

The first part of Undyne is the same as Neutral, but with one caveat. Because we will be saving in Hotland later on with the intent to reload and kill Undyne later, it is imperative to the route that you do not miss the cutscene skip for Undyne falling down in the water cooler room. Because of this, the "Safe One-Cycle" strat is recommended more strongly than it is in Neutral. 

First Trigger:

<img src='./Images/UndyneFirstTrigger.png' alt="Undyne first trigger" title="Undyne first trigger"></img>

Second Trigger:

<img src='./Images/UndyneSecondTrigger.png' alt="Undyne second trigger" title="Undyne second trigger"></img>

Wrong Warp Position:

<img src='./Images/UndyneWrongWarp.png' alt="Undyne wrong warp position" title="Undyne wrong warp position"></img>

Upon entering the room, walk up the path leading towards the rock structure. Run into the trigger and trigger the cutscene.

Optionally, you can also PCE this trigger, mash through until after the "NGAAAHHH" dialogue, and then call Toriel before mashing the rest of the dialogue. This saves a little time due to corrupting Undyne's text, but doesn't change the rest of the strat.

Mash through Undyne's remaining dialogue. After the cutscene ends and you regain movement, go down and right and save quickly. Then attempt to PCE the second trigger. If you fail to PCE the trigger and accidentally hit it, restart the game. Once you have PCE’d the second trigger, line up in the spot shown below. Note that the pixels will be different if you reload into the room than entering the room from the side.

<img src='./Images/SafeOneCycleTNT.png'></img>

Once you are in the above position, open the menu and then press <kbd>Z</kbd> three times quickly. This will open the punch card and skip Undyne's first textbox. Then, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>+<kbd>◀ Left</kbd>, wait for Undyne's second textbox to complete, and press <kbd>Z</kbd> one more time to close the punch card, regain movement, and advance to Undyne's third textbox. This technique is called TNT, and it allows you to get a wrong warp much easier than the other methods.

When you appear in the next room, you will be at the other end of the hallway. Immediately go up and into the next hallway. Go to the second part below.

It is still fully possible to do one of the other strategies described, however doing so is taking on somewhat more risk than it would be in other categories since you aren't able to safety save in the Undyne arena. 

#### Undyne Part 2

After wrong warping into the structure, you will appear at the end of the first hallway. Immediately go up as soon as you can. If you wait too long you will get caught by Undyne.

After entering the second hallway, you will need to walk to a specific position in the hallway to abuse an exploit. Once you enter the room you will see a sign. The left end of the sign will have a little notch in the ground under it. This will be the first notch under the sign. Walk to the 4th notch under the sign. Stay there and let Undyne catch you and start the battle. Being here will skip another cycle in the same room. Look at the image below. (Alternatively, you can just stop under the W in the sign.)

<img src='./Images/UndyneBattleStoppingPoint.png' alt="Undyne battle stopping point" title="Undyne battle stopping point"></img>

Once you begin the battle, end Undyne’s dialogue quickly after she turns you green.

Rather than Challenging Undyne, you want to FIGHT her. This is because it turns out that Undyne's HP is saved in your save file. FIGHT her until she turns your soul red, then flee. 

fter fleeing, just hold right. You will get a phone call from Papyrus a short time after fleeing from Undyne. Mash his dialogue and continue holding right. Exit through the right. In the next room, just hold right again. Exit through the right.

In the room with the water cooler, PCE the cutscene with Undyne collapsing on the ground from heat. PCE the trigger for the cutscene and immediately leave the room. **If you miss this PCE,** you are in an awkward spot. Wherever you last saved is now your **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** point, and you should finish the Undyne ending without saving. You will have to progress forward from wherever that save point was up until Undyne.

#### LEBP

LEBP, or "late early burnt pan" is a strategy for AME and True 100% that allows you to fight Undyne with the Pan. **This should only be done if you successfully PCE'd the Undyne water cutscene.** Play through the game until you recieve the burnt pan normally. Make sure not to kill Vulkin because you are still setting up for dog ending. Equip the pan immediately. Wrong warp out of the pan room into the previous room, then **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** at that room's save point. Continue as normal.

### Hotland

Hotland is identical to the Neutral route, except for the following things
- Do not save anywhere.
- There is a useful backup for if you miss the Mettaton EX PCE. Start the battle as quickly as possible, then immediately die. This will reload you to the CORE puzzle due to Undertale's hidden "autosave" mechanic.

### New Home
New Home is slightly different. Because you can mash through the text, magolor skip is no longer fast, and it is instead faster to do left side first.

Wrong warp into the room on the left. You can PCE slide the next encounter, but don’t bother trying to get text storage for it. After the encounter, grab the key from the kitchen and wrong warp out. You can also overflow the key for an overflow wrong warp. 

After this head to the right side. You can try to get text storage and use it on the encounter like you would in a normal new home. Once you grab second key, head back to the center room like you would normally and unlock the gate. Continue through new home and asgore as normal.
After fighting Asgore, you will be placed in the final room of the game, just as in Alphys ending. You still want to wait to reload until you see the title screen, because that will shorten Flowey's text even more.

## Mettaton Ending

> The Mettaton Ending is another Neutral ending, mainly consisting of Hotland, which is one of the more fun glitched areas.

Requirements:
- Toriel Dead
- Undyne Dead
- Mettaton Alive

### Undyne

You could reload to one of a few places, depending on what exactly happened in the previous ending. Regardless, make your way back to the Undyne fight. If you are coming from the Magma Chamber, almost every room will have a useful wrong warp.

Also of note if you are coming from Magma Chamber is that the Undyne Water Trigger will be skipped. It is easiest to do this by overflowing the water cooler and using the stored text, however if you are on 1.02+ this is not possible and you will have to PCE it instead. You can set up this PCE easily by running into the left-facing wall at the very top of the room, then walking down to the middle of the room, then buffering left once and opening the punch card.

Once you are at the Undyne fight, attack Undyne until she dies. If you missed the water trigger and had to reload to before you obtained the Burnt Pan, you can do the previously described "Pacifist Kindergarten" strat. Otherwise, just melt Undyne with the Burnt Pan. Remember that everything after you set her HP to 0 is a cutscene and you can switch to sparing her at that point.

### Hotland
Another Hotland that is identical to Neutral. Make sure you don't kill Vulkin as we are still on dog ending, but otherwise proceed as normal.

### Core

In this route we skip mettaton, but we would like to be able to fight him later. In order for this to happen, we need to skip the Alphys cutscene. This is done the same as in neutral, however because it is mandatory it is recommended to take a safety save so you can retry it if you don't get it.

### New Home

Finish Monstertale as in the Undyne Ending. **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** in Judgement Hall. Continue through the Asgore fight as normal.  At this point Flowey's dialog is as short as it can get, so you should reload as soon as you touch the door in the final room of the game rather than waiting for the logo to appear.

## Dog Ending

> The Dog Ending is a very short ending taken up almost entirely by the Mettaton fight.

Requirements:
- Toriel Dead
- Undyne Dead
- Mettaton Dead
- Papyrus Dead
- No other monsters dead

Once you have reloaded, backtrack to Long Elevator. Ride the elevator down (overflowing it if you can), then wrong warp out. If you don't wrong warp out, you will have to mash through a whole bunch of Alphys Text.

Wrong warp into Mettaton's room. For some reason if you enter normally, you're pushed out so this wrong warp is mandatory.

### Before the Mettaton Fight

You will attempt to open the punch card to get movement back, just like you did the first time you fought Mettaton, however it is more complicated to do that in an NG+ state. First, PCE the mettaton cutscene. Next, mash through the cutscene until Mettaton says "REALLY, WHERE?". During this time, you can head towards the room exit as long as you don't leave. There is no moving platform to push you out. After closing that text box, open the menu and hover over use on the punch card. Once the "CLEVER, VERY CLEVER" text appears, but before the textbox finishes, you want to press Enter, Shift, and Z in rapid succession just as you would for Flowerflow. If you are too slow in these inputs, then you will close the punch card too early. If you do the inputs after the textbox finishes, you will not open the punch card at all. Notably, the punch card is drawn behind the battler so if it looks like the punch card disappears, that doesn't necessarily mean you closed it early.

### The Mettaton Fight

The first phase of the fight is skipped because you are in NG+. The second phase of the fight is largely the same, however since you are a lower LV it will take a few more hits to kill him. Optimally you can finish the fight in 7 attacks. 

After the Mettaton fight, be sure to wait until Alphys starts talking to close the punch card. Then walk out of the room. This time Alphys Elevator skip is not mandatory, though it does still save time. After doing long elevator skip, **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** at the "Castle Elevator" save point. 

At the top left of the following room, there is an elevator that allows you to skip Monstertale. Because you saved after completing it in the previous ending, you will be able to take this elevator. Do so. The Asgore fight and Flowey encounter are exactly the same as in the previous ending

## No King Ending

> meme ending, unfortunately still necessary

Requirements:
- Toriel Dead
- Undyne Dead
- Mettaton Dead
- Papyrus Dead
- At least one other monsters dead

Ride the Long Elevator down (overflowing it if you can), then wrong warp out. If you don't wrong warp out and you did Alphys Elevator Skip previously, you will have to mash through a whole bunch of Alphys Text.

Wrong warp into Mettaton's room. For some reason if you enter normally, you're pushed out; so this wrong warp is mandatory.

Leave to the south, go to the bridge, and grind out a single encounter. After this, skip Mettaton. This time Alphys Elevator skip is not mandatory, though it does still save time. 

At the top left of the following room, there is an elevator that allows you to skip Monstertale. Because you saved after completing it in the previous ending, you will be able to take this elevator. Do so. The Asgore fight and Flowey encounter are exactly the same as in the previous ending.

## Family Ending

> This is strongly similar to the Neutral part of the [True Pacifist](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/TruePacifist "UTSR Guides - True Pacifist") speedrun.

Requirements:
- Multiple different potential requirements, however the one we're going for requires getting 0 kills.

This is identical to the Neutral part of the true pacifist route, with the following differences
- Flowey does not appear at all, including the fight at the end
- You can reload on touching the door, instead of waiting for the Undertale logo to appear

This is TPE, so make sure you don't forget to date Papyrus and **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** in Judgement Hall

## Exiled Queen Ending

> A fun break from TPE to do a bunch of distinctly non-pacifist activities.

Requirements
- Toriel alive
- 10 or more kills (or alternative requirements which we don't go for)

Backtrack to CORE just as you would in TPE. **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** in Core End. This is a particularly important save point because if you kill something and save afterwards, that invalidates TPE and you will have to start this entire ending over, losing well over an hour.

Your goal is 10 kills and you will accomplish that as follows:
- Cross the bridge and grind for an encounter on the left side of the bridge. This will be an Astigmatism (1).
- Go to Warrior's path and fight all 7 enemies there (8 total).
- Finally, return to core end, grinding out an encounter on the right side of the bridge. This will be a double (10).

Since you will be using the pie on Asgore, there is no need to heal after this. Doing so risks accidentally saving.

After this, go back to asgore. At the top left of the second room after long elevator, there is an elevator that allows you to skip Monstertale. Because you saved after completing it in the previous ending, you will be able to take this elevator. Do so. 

The Asgore fight and Flowey encounter are exactly the same as in the previous ending. Remember that you still have the pie and should use it on Asgore.

## True Pacifist Ending

> This is effectively identical to the post-Flowey part of the [True Pacifist](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/TruePacifist "UTSR Guides - True Pacifist") speedrun.

The ONLY difference between this and TPE as described in the True Pacifist guide is that you start at Core End instead of Judgement hall. Other than that, everything is exactly the same.

***End your timer on closing the "Everyone is waiting for us" textbox from Toriel.***
